**Ise Excel mein kaise banayein:**

1.  **Excel kholo:** Aapki system mein Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, ya koi bhi spreadsheet software kholo.
2.  **Headers daalo:** Pehli row mein uppar diye gaye headings (`Main Module`, `Sub Module`, `Concept`, etc.) daal do.
3.  **Data copy-paste karo:** Uppar table ki content ko select karo aur apni Excel sheet ki second row se paste karo.
4.  **Format karo:** `Main Module` jaise columns ko highlight karne ke liye bold ya different background color use karo, taaki visually easily track kar sako.

Aap chahein to `Status` aur `Priority` columns ke liye **Data Validation** (Dropdown lists) use kar sakte hain, jisse aap easily "Not Started", "In Progress", "Completed" ya "High", "Medium", "Low" select kar sako.
